    "This is not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of RNAseq analysis, but by the end of this module you will have completed a simple Group A vs. Group B differential expression analysis using publically-available RNAseq data derived from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/), [reanalyzed to remove computational batch effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3772), and [deposited for use](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN). This module also is a single example of how to do this analysis, but many different pipelines have been developed to give similar results. [Conesa et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728800/) published a fairly comprehensive review of RNAseq best practices and other groups have compared the effectiveness of different pipelines, such as [Soneson et al.](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-91) and [Teng et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842274/)\n",

    "The results of ENCODE suggested that ~80% of the genome is functional and that there are closer to 60,000 genes than 20,000. Most of the other genes discovered were non-coding genes, meaning the functioning unit is the RNA rather than the RNA serving only as a meassage to make protein. That means if used the [publically-available TCGA data](https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/) than we would only be analzing 1/3 of the possible data. However, it would be unreasonable for us to reanalyze all of the TCGA data (it would cost ~$800,000 in compute time) and because it is referenced-based it would contain identifiable information, meaning we would need a data use agreement to do so. Fortunately, all of TCGA data was [reanalyzed](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3772) with a newer genome annotation file that includes ~60,000 genes and ~200,000 transcripts. We will use this data that is available at from the [XENA Browser](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/), which hosts over 1500 publically-available datasets.  "

    "Breast cancer is a classic example of the use of precision treatment. Patients with cancerous cells that express the estrogen receptor (ER+) receive hormone therapy and a recent [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860917?dopt=Abstract) demonstrates that a subset of those patients based entirely on gene expression do not benefit from chemotherapy. Likewise, patients with cancerous cells with amplified ERBB2 (HER2) are treated with a targeted therapy that has dramatically improved the prognosis of those patients. However, patients with breast cancer cells that do not express ER, HER2, or the progesteron receptor (PR) have what is known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There are currently no targeted therapies for TNBC breast cancer. One might be interested in what genes are expressed differently in HER2+ vs. TNBC given that HER2+ are typically also ER and PR negative. We will ask that question using the TCGA counts data. \n",
